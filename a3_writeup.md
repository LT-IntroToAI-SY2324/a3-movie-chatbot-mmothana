# Assignment 3 - Writeup

Assignment 3 is all about creating this natural language query system.  In order to do so, you have to write a lot of functions to retrieve infomation.  You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.
    I find the 'search_pa_list' interesting because of how you it connects to other functions. It organizes the code by only getting what the question asks for. 

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
    I added 21 Jump Street which was made in 2012. The reason I added this movie was because it is one of my favorite comedy movies.

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?
    The action I added to the paList data structure is to return the list of answers if there is any but if there isn't, I return there are no answers for it or there isn't anything related to the thing being searched. This is a useful action because it returns whatever info is in the program being asked for if there is it.

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.
    A chatbot I would create that would be like this would be a chatbot about basketball. It would have information about basketball players and there all time stats. I would create this because I love the sport of basketball and it could help people get info about it easier.

5. What was the most difficult portion of this assignment?
    The most difficult portion of this assignment was the search_pa_list as it confused me. I was stuck and needed assistance doing it.

6. Did you write a new assert for your pattern action?
    I did not.
